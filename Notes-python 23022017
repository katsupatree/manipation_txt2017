Python day 2 -23022017
When setting up my directories
Home
  -virtal environments (for all my projects) folder
    -project (it's own virt enviroment)
      -git repo
      -virtual enviro (info/version)
##Dan says don't touch this shit!

 when set up virtualenv need to designate a directory (eg data_manip2017)
 then activate as discribed before

 set up git repo - use web for this
 then
 git clone URL
move to git repo
then add requirements.txt file - which will have the list of all tools

For data mani we added pandas, which contains numpy

##Enviroments are set up
##Working with the data - get data in/create data (sub)directory
with a git ignore so the files wont be added to git with the code

#Git ignore
Go to https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore
add dir that you would like to ignore eg data/
save to the right directory and add dir
to check run if git ignored run git status - should not appear at all "modified/untracked"

##Note the git ignore also has lots of other files to ignore eg virtualenvi info which we are storing outside our git repo
